## Development Commands
- `pnpm dev` - Start all apps in development mode
- `pnpm build` - Build all apps and packages  
- `pnpm test` - Run tests across all packages
- `pnpm migrate` - Run Prisma migrations
- `pnpm db:studio` - Open Prisma Studio on port 5555
- `pnpm email:dev` - Preview email templates on port 3003

## Nesting
- Avoid deeply nested code. Break down logic into smaller functions.
- Opening curly braces should be on the same line as the statement.
- Prefer composition over inheritance.

## Error Handling
- Always catch specific errors instead of generic ones.
- Use Zod for runtime validation and type safety.
- Log errors using the logging package (Sentry integration).
- Provide user-friendly error messages through toast notifications.

## Authentication
- Use Better Auth for all authentication needs.
- Session management is handled automatically.
- Check authentication status using `auth()` from `@packages/auth`.

## Database
- All database operations go through Prisma in the `@packages/db` package.
- Database schema is located in `packages/db/prisma/schema.prisma`.
- Use transactions for complex operations.
- Always handle database errors gracefully.

## Environment Variables
- **NEVER use `process.env` directly** - always use the typed `env` object from `@/env`
- All environment variables MUST be defined in the appropriate `keys.ts` file with Zod validation
- Add new env vars to both the schema and `runtimeEnv` object in keys.ts
- Use proper validation (e.g., `z.string().regex(URL_REGEX)` for URLs, `z.string().email()` for emails)
- Example: `import { env } from '@/env'; if (env.VERCEL) { ... }`
- This ensures type safety and runtime validation of all environment variables
