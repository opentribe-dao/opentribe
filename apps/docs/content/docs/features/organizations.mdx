# Organizations

Turbocamp includes a comprehensive multi-tenant organization system built with Better Auth's organization plugin. This allows your users to create teams, invite members, and manage permissions.

## Overview

The organization system provides:

- **Multi-tenant Architecture** - Users can belong to multiple organizations
- **Role-Based Access Control** - Owner, admin, and member roles
- **Team Management** - Invite, remove, and manage team members
- **Organization Switching** - Seamless context switching
- **Scoped Resources** - Data isolation between organizations

<Callout type="info">
  Organizations are limited to 5 per user and 100 members per organization by default. These limits can be adjusted in the auth configuration.
</Callout>

## Key Features

### Organization Creation

Users can create organizations with:
- Custom organization name
- URL-friendly slug
- Logo upload (coming soon)
- Metadata storage for custom fields

### Member Management

Organization owners and admins can:
- Invite new members via email
- Assign roles (admin or member)
- Remove members
- Update member permissions

### Role Hierarchy

<Tabs items={['Owner', 'Admin', 'Member']}>
  <Tab value="Owner">
    - Full control over organization
    - Can delete the organization
    - Can manage all members and roles
    - Cannot be removed by others
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="Admin">
    - Can invite and remove members
    - Can change member roles (except owner)
    - Can update organization settings
    - Cannot delete the organization
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="Member">
    - Basic access to organization resources
    - Cannot manage other members
    - Cannot change organization settings
    - Can leave the organization
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Implementation Guide

### Creating an Organization

<Steps>
  <Step>
    Navigate to the dashboard and click "Create Organization" in the sidebar
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Enter organization details:
    ```typescript
    const result = await organization.create({
      name: "Acme Inc",
      slug: "acme-inc", // Optional, auto-generated if not provided
    });
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step>
    The new organization is automatically set as active:
    ```typescript
    await organization.setActive({
      organizationId: result.data.id,
    });
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Managing Members

#### Inviting Members

```typescript
await organization.inviteMember({
  organizationId: activeOrg.id,
  email: "colleague@example.com",
  role: "member", // or "admin"
});
```

<Callout type="warning">
  Email invitations require email service configuration. Until configured, invitations are logged to the console.
</Callout>

#### Updating Member Roles

```typescript
await organization.updateMemberRole({
  organizationId: activeOrg.id,
  memberIdOrEmail: memberId,
  role: "admin",
});
```

#### Removing Members

```typescript
await organization.removeMember({
  organizationId: activeOrg.id,
  memberIdOrEmail: memberId,
});
```

### Organization Switching

The organization switcher is available in the dashboard sidebar:

```typescript
// Get list of user's organizations
const { data: organizations } = useListOrganizations();

// Get current active organization
const { data: activeOrg } = useActiveOrganization();

// Switch to a different organization
await organization.setActive({
  organizationId: orgId,
});
```

## Database Schema

The organization system uses these Prisma models:

```prisma
model Organization {
  id          String       @id
  name        String
  slug        String?
  logo        String?
  createdAt   DateTime
  metadata    String?
  members     Member[]
  invitations Invitation[]
  
  @@unique([slug])
}

model Member {
  id             String       @id
  organizationId String
  organization   Organization @relation(...)
  userId         String
  user           User         @relation(...)
  role           String
  createdAt      DateTime
}

model Invitation {
  id             String       @id
  organizationId String
  organization   Organization @relation(...)
  email          String
  role           String?
  status         String
  expiresAt      DateTime
  inviterId      String
  user           User         @relation(...)
}
```

## API Endpoints

Better Auth automatically provides these endpoints:

- `POST /api/auth/organization.create` - Create new organization
- `POST /api/auth/organization.update` - Update organization details
- `POST /api/auth/organization.delete` - Delete organization
- `POST /api/auth/organization.setActive` - Switch active organization
- `POST /api/auth/organization.inviteMember` - Send invitation
- `POST /api/auth/organization.removeMember` - Remove member
- `POST /api/auth/organization.updateMemberRole` - Change member role
- `GET /api/auth/organization.getFullOrganization` - Get organization with members

## Configuration

Organizations are configured in `packages/auth/server.ts`:

```typescript
import { organization } from 'better-auth/plugins';

export const auth = betterAuth({
  plugins: [
    organization({
      allowUserToCreateOrganization: true,
      organizationLimit: 5,
      membershipLimit: 100,
      creatorRole: 'owner',
      sendInvitationEmail: async (data) => {
        // Implement email sending
        await sendEmail({
          to: data.email,
          subject: `Invitation to join ${data.organization.name}`,
          // ... email template
        });
      },
    }),
  ],
});
```

## Best Practices

1. **Scope All Resources** - Always filter data by organization ID
2. **Check Permissions** - Verify user roles before allowing actions
3. **Handle Edge Cases** - Users with no organizations, deleted organizations
4. **Audit Logging** - Track organization changes for compliance
5. **Rate Limiting** - Prevent abuse of invitation system

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

<Tabs items={['No Organizations', 'Permission Denied', 'Invitation Failed']}>
  <Tab value="No Organizations">
    **Problem**: User sees "No Organization" after sign up
    
    **Solution**: Redirect new users to `/organization/new` or auto-create a default organization:
    ```typescript
    if (!activeOrg && organizations.length === 0) {
      router.push('/organization/new');
    }
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="Permission Denied">
    **Problem**: User cannot perform organization actions
    
    **Solution**: Check user role in the organization:
    ```typescript
    const member = organization.members.find(m => m.userId === user.id);
    if (member.role !== 'owner' && member.role !== 'admin') {
      throw new Error('Insufficient permissions');
    }
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="Invitation Failed">
    **Problem**: Email invitations not being sent
    
    **Solution**: Configure email service in auth settings:
    ```typescript
    sendInvitationEmail: async (data) => {
      // Ensure email service is configured
      if (!process.env.RESEND_API_KEY) {
        console.log('Email invitation:', data);
        return;
      }
      // Send actual email
    }
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>
