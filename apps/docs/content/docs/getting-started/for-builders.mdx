## Setting Up for Payments

To receive payments when you win, you need a Polkadot wallet:

<Steps>

<Step title="Choose a Wallet">
Pick a wallet that works for you:
- **Talisman**: User-friendly, great for desktop
- **SubWallet**: Works on both browser and mobile
- **Polkadot.js Extension**: Simple and lightweight
</Step>

<Step title="Install & Secure It">
1. Download from the official site only  
2. Install the extension or mobile app  
3. Create a new account and set a strong password  
4. Back up the seed phrase offline before moving on
</Step>

<Step title="Grab Your Polkadot Address">
Open the wallet, switch to the Polkadot network, and copy the address that starts with `1`. This is the address orgs will pay.
</Step>

<Step title="Add It to Opentribe">
Go to your profile settings, find the Wallet Address field, paste your address, and save. You can update it anytime.
</Step>

</Steps>

For detailed wallet setup, see our [wallet setup guide](/docs/getting-started/setup-wallet).

## Common Questions

### How much can I earn?

Bounties range from $50 for simple tasks to $5,000+ for complex work. Grants can be $10,000-$100,000+ for substantial projects.

### How do I get paid?

Organizations send payments directly from their wallet to yours (outside of Opentribe). Payments are typically in DOT or any Asset Hub asset the org has budgeted for. Opentribe tracks and verifies these payments on-chain. See our [payments guide](/docs/payments/receiving-payments).

### How long until I receive payment?

After being selected as a winner, organizations typically pay within a few days to 2 weeks. The payment happens directly between wallets, and Opentribe verifies the transaction once complete.

### Can I work on multiple bounties?

Yes! There's no limit to how many bounties you can apply to or work on simultaneously.

### What if I don't have Polkadot experience?

Many bounties welcome builders from other ecosystems. Use it as an opportunity to learn!

### Can I collaborate with others?

Some bounties explicitly allow team submissions. Check the bounty details. For grants, teams are often encouraged.
