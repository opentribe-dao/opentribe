## Overview

To receive bounty payments on Opentribe, you need a Polkadot wallet. This guide will help you choose the right wallet and set it up correctly.

<Callout type="info">
  Most organizations pay through Polkadot's Asset Hub, which supports DOT, USDC, USDT, and other tokens. All recommended wallets work with Asset Hub.
</Callout>

- **SubWallet** - Full mobile app for iOS and Android

**For Technical Users:**

## Viewing Your Asset Hub Balances

To see your DOT and other tokens:

### In Talisman:
- Switch the network dropdown to "Asset Hub"

### In SubWallet:
- Enable "Polkadot Asset Hub" in network settings

### In Polkadot.js:
- Use [Polkadot.js Apps](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/)
- Connect to "Polkadot Asset Hub"

## Security Best Practices

<Callout type="error">
  Following these security practices is critical to keeping your funds safe.
</Callout>

### Seed Phrase Security

**DO:**
- ✅ Write your seed phrase on paper
- ✅ Store in a safe place (safe, bank vault)
- ✅ Consider using a metal backup for fire/water protection
- ✅ Test your seed phrase recovery

**DON'T:**
- ❌ Save seed phrase digitally (no screenshots, no cloud storage)
- ❌ Share with anyone (even Opentribe support)
- ❌ Email or message your seed phrase
- ❌ Type it into any website except your wallet

### Password Best Practices

- Use a unique, strong password for your wallet
- Different from your email or Opentribe password
- Consider using a password manager
- Enable biometric unlock on mobile if available

### Wallet Safety

- Only download wallets from official websites:
  - Talisman: [talisman.xyz](https://talisman.xyz)
  - SubWallet: [subwallet.app](https://subwallet.app)
  - Polkadot.js: [polkadot.js.org/extension/](https://polkadot.js.org/extension/)
- Verify browser extension before installing
- Be cautious of phishing websites
- Never enter your seed phrase on any website

### Hardware Wallets (Advanced)

For large amounts, consider a hardware wallet:

- **Ledger Nano S/X** - Supported by all three wallets
- **Keystone** - Supported by SubWallet
- **Polkadot Vault** - Supported by SubWallet

Hardware wallets store your private keys offline, providing maximum security.

## Common Issues

### Can't See an Asset Hub Balance

**Solution:**
1. Make sure you're connected to the Asset Hub network
2. In Talisman: Switch to "Asset Hub - Polkadot"
3. In SubWallet: Enable Asset Hub in network settings
4. Wallets need a small amount of DOT (~0.1) for the account to be active

### Address Starts with Different Letter

**Issue:** Address doesn't start with `1`

**Solution:**
- Polkadot addresses start with `1`
- Kusama addresses start with capital letters
- Make sure you're copying the Polkadot address, not Kusama
- The same seed phrase generates different addresses for different networks

### Lost Access to Wallet

**With Seed Phrase:**
1. Install wallet on a new device
2. Choose "Import from seed phrase"
3. Enter your 12-word seed phrase
4. Your account is recovered

**Without Seed Phrase:**
- Unfortunately, your wallet cannot be recovered
- This is why backing up your seed phrase is critical

### Wallet Extension Not Detected

**Solution:**
1. Refresh the webpage
2. Make sure extension is installed and unlocked
3. Check if extension has permission for the site
4. Try a different browser
5. Reinstall extension if necessary

## Testing Your Wallet

Before receiving large payments, test with a small amount:

<Steps>

<Step title="Get Test DOT">
1. Use a faucet or buy a small amount of DOT on an exchange  
2. Send ~1 DOT to your wallet as a test
</Step>

<Step title="Verify Receipt">
1. Check your wallet balance  
2. Look for the transaction on Subscan: [assethub-polkadot.subscan.io](https://assethub-polkadot.subscan.io/)  
3. Confirm you can see the balance
</Step>

<Step title="Practice Sending (Optional)">
1. Send a tiny amount (0.01 DOT) to another address  
2. Make sure you understand the process  
3. Check the transaction fee
</Step>

</Steps>
