# How Payments Work on Opentribe

Opentribe is a **talent marketplace** that connects builders with opportunities. We surface every bounty, grant, and RFP in one place and keep payment history transparent—while you stay fully self-custodial.

## You Stay in Control of Funds

<Callout type="info">
  Opentribe never holds, transfers, or escrows funds. Organizations pay builders directly from their own wallets, and Opentribe verifies that the on-chain transaction happened.
</Callout>

## The Payment Flow

Here's how payments actually work on Opentribe:

### 1. Opportunity Completion
- Builder submits work to a bounty or gets approved for a grant
- Organization reviews and selects winners
- Winner selection is recorded on Opentribe

### 2. Direct Payment (Off-Platform)
- Organization goes to **their own wallet** (Talisman, SubWallet, Polkadot.js, etc.)
- Organization sends payment **directly** to the builder's wallet address
- This transaction happens entirely on the Polkadot/Asset Hub blockchain
- Opentribe is not involved in this step

### 3. Payment Recording
- After sending payment, the organization returns to Opentribe
- Organization records the payment details:
  - Amount sent
  - Token used (DOT or another Asset Hub asset)
  - Transaction hash (extrinsic hash) from the blockchain
- This creates a payment record in Opentribe's database

### 4. Payment Verification
- Opentribe automatically verifies the transaction using Subscan API
- We check:
  - Transaction exists on-chain
  - Transaction was successful
  - It was a balance transfer
- Verification status is displayed to both parties

## What Opentribe Provides

### For Builders
- **Visibility**: See payment status and transaction details
- **Verification**: Confirm payments were made on-chain
- **Records**: Track all payments received across opportunities
- **Trust**: On-chain verification provides transparency

### For Organizations
- **Record Keeping**: Document all payments made
- **Compliance**: Maintain records of disbursements
- **Transparency**: Show payment history to community
- **Verification**: Prove payments were completed

## Payment Verification

When an organization records a payment, Opentribe:

1. **Stores the transaction hash** provided by the organization
2. **Queries Subscan API** to verify the transaction
3. **Updates payment status** based on blockchain confirmation
4. **Displays verification badge** when confirmed

You can always verify any payment independently by:
- Clicking the transaction hash to view on Subscan
- Checking the blockchain directly using any explorer
- Verifying sender/receiver addresses match

## Common Questions

### Why doesn't Opentribe process payments directly?

Opentribe focuses on being the best talent marketplace for discovering opportunities. By not handling payments, we:
- Keep the platform simple and focused
- Avoid regulatory complexity
- Let organizations use their preferred payment methods
- Maintain decentralization principles

### What if an organization doesn't pay?

Since payments happen directly between parties:
- Check the payment status on Opentribe
- Verify the transaction hash on Subscan if provided
- Contact the organization directly
- Report issues to the Opentribe team for mediation support

### Can I trust the payment records?

All payment records are verified against the actual blockchain:
- Transaction hashes can't be faked (they're verified on-chain)
- Subscan provides independent verification
- The blockchain is immutable and transparent
- Anyone can verify any transaction independently

## Supported Tokens

Organizations typically pay in DOT (Polkadot’s native token) or any other asset that’s registered on Asset Hub—foreign parachain tokens and bridged stablecoins can all be managed there. [Source](https://docs.polkadot.com/polkadot-protocol/architecture/system-chains/asset-hub/)

Document the token inside your bounty/grant so builders know what to expect.
