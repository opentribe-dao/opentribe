# Payment Wallets & Asset Hub

Many organizations in the Polkadot ecosystem use Asset Hub to manage and send payments. It's a system parachain that supports DOT, USDC, USDT, and other tokens.

## What is Asset Hub?

Asset Hub is Polkadot's official parachain for managing tokens and assets. Think of it as a shared wallet system where:
- Organizations can hold multiple types of tokens
- Payments are fast and secure
- All transactions are publicly visible

<Callout type="info">
  Organizations send payments directly from their Asset Hub wallets to builders. Opentribe doesn't process these payments - we just verify they happened.
</Callout>

## How Payments Work

1. **Organization selects a winner** on Opentribe
2. **Organization sends payment** directly from their wallet to the builder's wallet
3. **Organization records the transaction hash** on Opentribe
4. **Opentribe verifies** the payment happened on-chain

## For Organizations: Using Asset Hub

If your organization uses Asset Hub to manage funds, here's a simple guide:

<Steps>

<Step title="Check Your Balance">
Open your wallet (Talisman, SubWallet, or Polkadot.js) and switch to Asset Hub to see your available tokens.
</Step>

<Step title="Send Payment to Builder">
Copy the builder's address from their Opentribe profile, enter the amount, and send the payment.
</Step>

<Step title="Record on Opentribe">
After sending, copy the transaction hash and record it on the bounty/grant page in Opentribe.
</Step>

</Steps>

## For Builders: Receiving Asset Hub Payments

When you receive payments from organizations:

1. **Check your wallet**: Switch to Asset Hub network to see incoming payments
2. **View on Subscan**: Click the transaction hash in Opentribe to see details on [Subscan](https://assethub-polkadot.subscan.io/)
3. **Multiple tokens**: You might receive DOT, USDC, USDT, or other tokens depending on what the organization uses

## Common Asset Hub Tokens

Organizations typically pay in:
- **DOT**: Native Polkadot token
- **USDC**: USD stablecoin
- **USDT**: Tether stablecoin
- **Other tokens**: Various parachain tokens

## Important Notes

- Asset Hub accounts need a small amount of DOT (~0.1) to stay active
- Transaction fees are minimal (less than 0.01 DOT)
- All payments are final once confirmed on-chain

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
| --- | --- |
| Can't see payment in wallet | Switch your wallet to Asset Hub network |
| Transaction not showing | Wait a few moments or check Subscan directly |
| Wrong token received | Contact the organization to clarify |
| Balance not updating | Refresh your wallet or reconnect |
