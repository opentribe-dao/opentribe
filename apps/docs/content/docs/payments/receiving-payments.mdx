# Receiving Payments as a Builder

As a builder on Opentribe, you receive payments directly from organizations to your Polkadot wallet. Here's everything you need to know.

<Callout type="info">
  As a builder, you track payments through your profile on opentribe.io (not the organization dashboard at admin.opentribe.io).
</Callout>

## Before You Begin

<Callout type="warning">
  Add your Polkadot address to your profile settings. Organizations need this address to send you payments.
</Callout>

### Prerequisites

1. ✅ **Polkadot Wallet**: Set up and secure (see [Wallet Setup Guide](/docs/getting-started/setup-wallet))
2. ✅ **Wallet Address in Profile**: Added to your Opentribe profile
3. ✅ **Completed Work**: Submitted and selected as winner

## Payment Process

### Step 1: Win an Opportunity

1. Submit your work to a bounty or apply for a grant
2. Organization reviews submissions/applications
3. You're selected as a winner
4. You'll receive a notification of your selection

### Step 2: Organization Sends Payment

After selecting you as a winner, the organization:

1. **Goes to their own wallet** (not through Opentribe)
2. **Sends payment directly** to your wallet address
3. **Records the payment** on Opentribe with the transaction hash

<Callout type="info">
  Opentribe does not process this payment. The organization sends funds directly from their wallet to yours on the blockchain.
</Callout>

### Step 3: Payment Confirmation

Once the organization records the payment:

1. **Check your profile on Opentribe** for payment status
2. **Verify the transaction hash** - click to view on Subscan
3. **Check your wallet** for the received funds
4. **Confirmation email** sent when payment is verified

## Tracking Your Payments

### On Your Opentribe Profile

Navigate to **Your Profile → Payments** on opentribe.io to see:

- **Pending Payments**: Won opportunities awaiting payment
- **Completed Payments**: Verified on-chain transactions
- **Payment History**: All your received payments

Each payment entry shows:
- Organization name
- Bounty/Grant title
- Amount and token
- Status (Pending/Verified/Failed)
- Transaction hash (link to Subscan)
- Date

### In Your Wallet

Check your wallet app (Talisman, SubWallet, etc.) for:
- Incoming transactions
- Current balance
- Transaction history

## Payment Timeline

Typical payment timeline after winning:

| Stage | Typical Duration | What Happens |
|-------|-----------------|--------------|
| **Selection** | Day 0 | You're selected as winner |
| **Processing** | 1-7 days | Organization prepares payment |
| **Payment Sent** | Day 2-7 | Organization sends from their wallet |
| **Blockchain Confirmation** | 6-12 seconds | Transaction confirms on-chain |
| **Opentribe Verification** | 1-5 minutes | Automatic verification via Subscan |

<Callout type="info">
  Payment timing depends on the organization's internal processes. Some pay immediately, others have weekly/monthly payment cycles.
</Callout>

## Verifying Your Payment

### Method 1: Through Opentribe

1. Go to your payment in your profile on opentribe.io
2. Click the transaction hash
3. You'll be redirected to Subscan
4. Verify:
   - Sender address (organization)
   - Receiver address (your wallet)
   - Amount and token
   - Success status

### Method 2: Direct Blockchain Check

1. Copy the transaction hash from Opentribe
2. Go to [Subscan.io](https://subscan.io)
3. Paste the hash in the search box
4. Review transaction details

### Method 3: In Your Wallet

1. Open your wallet app
2. Check transaction history
3. Match the amount and sender

## Common Payment Tokens

Organizations typically pay in DOT, USDC, USDT, or other tokens available on Asset Hub.

The payment token should be specified in the bounty or grant description.

## What If Payment Is Delayed?

If payment hasn't arrived after the expected timeline:

### 1. Check Payment Status
- Review status on your profile at opentribe.io
- Look for any notes from the organization

### 2. Verify Your Wallet Address
- Ensure your profile has the correct address
- Check for any typos or errors

### 3. Contact the Organization
- Use Opentribe messaging (if available)
- Reach out via their listed contact methods
- Be professional and provide:
  - Opportunity title
  - Selection date
  - Your wallet address

### 4. Contact Opentribe Support
If you can't resolve with the organization:
- Email support with details
- Include opportunity link
- Provide timeline of events

## Tax Considerations

<Callout type="warning">
  **Tax Responsibility**: As an independent contractor, you're responsible for reporting income and paying taxes according to your local regulations.
</Callout>

Consider:
- Keeping records of all payments
- Transaction hashes serve as proof
- Consult a tax professional
- Some jurisdictions tax crypto income differently

## Security Best Practices

### Protect Your Wallet
- Never share your private keys/seed phrase
- Use hardware wallets for large amounts
- Keep wallet software updated
- Enable all security features

### Verify Before Trusting
- Always verify transaction hashes
- Double-check sender addresses
- Confirm amounts match agreements
- Be wary of phishing attempts

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can Opentribe reverse or cancel a payment?
No. Opentribe doesn't process payments. Once a blockchain transaction is confirmed, it cannot be reversed.

### What if I provided the wrong wallet address?
Contact the organization immediately. If payment hasn't been sent, they can update the address. If already sent, the funds cannot be recovered.

### How long do I have to wait for payment?
This varies by organization. Check the opportunity description for payment terms. Most organizations pay within 1-2 weeks of selection.

### Can I request payment in a different token?
You'll need to discuss this with the organization directly. Opentribe doesn't control payment terms.

### What if the payment amount is wrong?
Contact the organization to resolve. Provide the transaction hash and explain the discrepancy.
