# Common Payment Tokens

Organizations pay builders directly using various tokens available on Polkadot's Asset Hub. Here are the most common options you'll see in bounties and grants.

  Remember: Organizations send payments directly to your wallet. Opentribe only tracks and verifies these payments - we don't process them.

## Most Common Tokens

### DOT (Polkadot)
- The most common payment token
- Native to the Polkadot network
- Supported by all wallets

### USDC (USD Coin)
- Stablecoin pegged to US Dollar
- Good for fixed-value bounties
- Available on Asset Hub

### USDT (Tether)
- Another USD stablecoin option
- Widely used for payments
- Also on Asset Hub

### Other Tokens
- Various parachain tokens
- Project-specific tokens
- Always specified in the bounty/grant description

## What Token Will You Get Paid In?

The organization posting the bounty or grant will specify which token they'll use for payment. Look for this information in:
- The bounty/grant description
- The "Payment Token" field
- The reward details section

## For Organizations

When posting opportunities, clearly specify:
1. **Which token** you'll pay in (DOT, USDC, etc.)
2. **The exact amount** in that token
3. **Where the funds come from** (your Asset Hub wallet)
