# v1.2.0: Curator Management & Bounty Submissions

We're excited to announce **Opentribe v1.2.0**, our biggest release since launch. This update brings powerful new features for organizations managing bounties and builders submitting their work.

## Multiple Curator Support

Organizations can now invite multiple curators to manage their bounties. This is a game-changer for teams that need collaborative bounty management.

### What's New

- **Invite curators** to help manage your bounties
- **Role-based permissions** ensure curators can only edit active bounties
- **Smart restrictions** prevent modifications to closed or completed bounties
- **Enhanced contact options** make it easy to reach curators directly from bounty pages

Whether you're running a small project or managing a large grants program, multiple curators help distribute the workload and bring diverse perspectives to your bounty evaluations.

## Complete Bounty Submission System

The submission workflow has been completely rebuilt from the ground up:

- **Full CRUD operations** - Create, read, update, and delete submissions
- **Attachment support** - Upload files with URL validation and proper naming
- **Position assignment** - Rank submissions and assign winner positions
- **Edit mode** - Builders can refine their submissions before the deadline
- **Screening validation** - Boolean screening questions with automatic normalization

## Boolean Screening Questions

Organizations can now add yes/no screening questions to bounties. This makes it easy to filter submissions based on eligibility criteria upfront.

## Documentation & Infrastructure

- New footer component for the documentation site
- Analytics and Sentry monitoring for docs
- Sentry initialization is now optional (only when DSN is configured)

## Automated Discord Notifications

Every release now automatically posts to our Discord community. Stay updated on new features by joining our server.

## Bug Fixes

- Fixed header mobile menu click-outside behavior
- Resolved screening answer persistence issues
- Improved Zod validation error handling
- Better organization membership validation for submissions

## What's Next

We're continuing to build out the Polkadot talent marketplace with more features for builders and organizations. Stay tuned for:

- Enhanced reputation system
- Improved search and discovery
- More payment options
